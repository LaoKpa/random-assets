This technology, based on deep learning, allows our users to analyse sentences, detect their intent (classification) and extract key information called entities (named entity recognition or NER). Recast.AI provides by default an extensive enrichment of 35+ entities such as location, datetimes or temperatures. To this we've also added emoji support, sentiment analysis, dialog management or expression suggestions, leveraging data augmentation to drastically fasten bot building. This NLP technology allows the creation of chatbots in any language, from English to Hebrew through Japanese. \nSecond, bot building is done through our free platform. In this platform, we've developed a complete suite of tools for bot building. Developers can train their bot, build their conversational flow in a visual builder (using our unique Bot Skills technology), connect bots to any channel in a few clicks (Messenger, Slack, Kik, Skype, etc) and monitor its use. All of this for free.\nFinally, from the beginning, Recast.AI has been a collaborative platform. Today, more than 25,000 developers use our technology and tools. Bots built on Recast.AI can be forked, Bot Skills can be shared, and you can work collaboratively on a bot. The community also exchanges tips and tricks on our Slack Community.\n\nWhile our technology is used by developers all around the world, we also work closely with major corporations to automate their customer supports with chatbots. \n\nWith Recast.AI, you have all tools necessary to the building of powerful bots and can provide great conversational interfaces in a heartbeat. \"", "Value

With Luminoso, GSK was able to:\n\n- instantly surface drivers or parent apprehension around the vaccination process\n- leverage new understanding of parental concerns to create new educational material, messaging, and patient interaction strategies \u2013 all in a fraction of the time it would have taken with traditional methods of research and analysis.", "Video URL": ""}, "6": {"Title": "Global Consumer Electronics Company", "Logo": null, "Long Description": "A leading global consumer electronics company was about to launch their first wearable technology product.

Recast.AI provides by default an extensive enrichment of 35+ entities such as location, datetimes or temperatures. To this we've also added emoji support, sentiment analysis, dialog management or expression suggestions, leveraging data augmentation to drastically fasten bot building. This NLP technology allows the creation of chatbots in any language, from English to Hebrew through Japanese. \nSecond, bot building is done through our free platform. In this platform, we've developed a complete suite of tools for bot building. Developers can train their bot, build their conversational flow in a visual builder (using our unique Bot Skills technology), connect bots to any channel in a few clicks (Messenger, Slack, Kik, Skype, etc) and monitor its use.

The community also exchanges tips and tricks on our Slack Community.\n\nWhile our technology is used by developers all around the world, we also work closely with major corporations to automate their

This technology, based on deep learning, allows our users to analyse sentences, detect their intent (classification) and extract key information called entities (named entity recognition or NER). Recast.AI provides by default an extensive enrichment of 35+ entities such as location, datetimes or temperatures. To this we've also added emoji support, sentiment analysis, dialog management or expression suggestions, leveraging data augmentation to drastically fasten bot building. This NLP technology allows the creation of chatbots in any language, from English to Hebrew through Japanese. \nSecond, bot building is done through our free platform. In this platform, we've developed a complete suite of tools for bot building. Developers can train their bot, build their conversational flow in a visual builder (using our unique Bot Skills technology), connect bots to any channel in a few clicks (Messenger, Slack, Kik, Skype, etc) and monitor its use. All of this for free.\nFinally, from the beginning, Recast.AI has been a collaborative platform. Today, more than 25,000 developers use our technology and tools. Bots built on Recast.AI can be forked, Bot Skills can be shared, and you can work collaboratively on a bot. The community also exchanges tips and tricks on our Slack Community.\n\nWhile our technology is used by developers all around the world, we also work closely with major corporations to automate their customer supports with chatbots. \n\nWith Recast.AI, you have all tools necessary to the building of powerful bots and can provide great conversational interfaces in a heartbeat. \"", "Value

While other services, such as Kayak fare predictor and Skyscanner, offer similar fare movement forecast options, the niche is still highly competitive as there is always room for improvement.\n\nArmed with 10+ years of experience in the travel industry, our client has decided to enter the competition in order to provide users with better customer service and more price saving opportunities. The goal was to build an intelligent algorithm, able to forecast future price movements based on historical data and smart predictive analytics models.\n\nThe project consisted of several tasks:\n\nIn-depth research and historical data analysis\nPrediction algorithm development and enhancements\nUser experience and performance optimization\nValue Delivered\nSimilar to Bing travel predictor, the Fareboom Price Predictor is aimed at helping users make informed decisions as to when to buy tickets or how long to wait to get the best flight deals. In order to provide the expected project results, our team delivered the following milestones:\n\nUncovering the Hidden Patterns in Large Dataset\nTo be able to predict the future price movements, our data scientists studied the historical data about airfare trend changes over the past several years. The actual information from millions of searches, processed by the Fareboom search engine was used, to make the predictions highly reliable. In order to increase the amount of data and statistical power, we handled neighbor travel dates data and clever merging algorithms to form the time series for further forecasting. Employing advanced data mining and aggregation techniques, the team was able to understand and visualize the hidden patterns.\n\nPredicting the Future Price Movements with High Confidence\nBased on discovered patterns, the team formed algorithm models with different parameters. The info about actual flight fares helped us find the most suitable prediction algorithm: Setting the system parameters of the recent past, our data scientist ran the algorithm to predict the fares we already knew. Thus, we were able to validate or disprove the hypothesis based on exact information. The final algorithm has an average confidence rate of 75% and uses a time series forecasting to make both long-term (7 weeks) and short-term (7 days) predictions. The algorithm is constantly being improved through machine learning techniques, based on the factual information about the confirmed and disproved predictions.\n\nSeamless Price Predictor Integration and Optimized Experience\nThe Price Predictor feature is integrated into the existing fare search functionality and is shown to a certain segment of the Fareboom users (currently about 20%). Being displayed in a form of a search module and a popup window, it is sure to grasp the user\u2019s attention and allows for a multitude of interactions (e.g. Close Popup, See More) and events (e.g. scroll, hover over, etc.). Therefore, we can track multiple stats and adjust the user experience based on them. For example, we have found that Price Predictor has doubled the average time per session within a month since the release and continues to grow the conversion.", "Video URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1P8yokFf8&feature=youtu.be"}}, "Address": {"City": "Carlsbad", "Region": "California", "Country": "United States"}, "Founded Year": 2007, "Number Of Employees": 200, "Capital Raised": 0, "Capital Raised Currency": "$", "How It Works Text": "Our services:\n\nEngineering services\n           \u2219 Software Product Development\n           \u2219 Team Extension\n\nData Science\n           \u2219 Machine Learning\n           \u2219 Predictive Analytics\n\nUX/UI Consulting\n           \u2219 UX Design\n           \u2219 Conversion Rate Optimization\n\nTechnology Consulting\n          \u2219 Enterprise Architecture\n          \u2219 Performance Improvements\n          \u2219 Cloud Services\n\n\nDomain expertise: \n    \u2219 Finance \n    \u2219 Health Care\n    \u2219 eCommerce & Retail\n    \u2219 Travel\n    \u2219 Media & Entertainment\n    \u2219 Marketing\n    \u2219 Aviation & Transportation\n\n\nTechnology expertise:\n\n    \u2219 Microsoft.NET \n    \u2219 LAMP \n    \u2219 HTML, CSS, UI JavaScript\n    \u2219 Cross-Platform and Native Mobile \n    \u2219 Java \n    \u2219 R, Python \n    \u2219 Cloud Technologies \n    \u2219 Full Stack JavaScript", "How It Works Video Url": null, "Value Proposition Text": "Being a Technology & Solution Consulting company, we co-build technology products to help companies accelerate growth.

Computers are able to ingest large and complex data sets and do what humans are incapable of, which is to make sense of all possible relationships amongst that data, in a reasonable amount of time. This is true even when the data involved is massive\u2013 imagine trying to make sense of a spreadsheet with billions of rows or a hundred thousand columns. Humans don\u2019t even know where to begin.  The industrial revolution in the early 19th century caused a shift in human capabilities. Machines improved the quality of what could be manufactured, increased workforce productivity, replaced unskilled human labor, and enabled the development of new products that were far beyond the capabilities of humans to produce. AI is rapidly creating a parallel revolution, but this time for knowledge-based processes instead of physical processes, and for white-collar workers instead of factory employees.  The collection and analysis of data from transactions, sensors, and biometrics continues to grow at a prodigious rate, taxing the analytic capabilities of even the most sophisticated organizations. The quantity of possible insights in a given dataset is an exponential function of the number of data points. On top of this, aggregate data growth is an exponential function with time. Unfortunately, the world cannot train enough data scientists to meet this runaway, double-exponential demand curve for analytics.  This dynamic is driving computer scientists and mathematicians alike to examine new approaches to interact with big and high dimensional data.  Today\u2019s hypothesis-driven analytics and manual machine learning algorithms and statistical tools will not suffice. High-performance computers and algorithms can examine big and complex data far faster and seek insights more comprehensively than any human is capable of.   Ayasdi's core technology innovation is our development of artificial intelligence platform that automatically selects and combines multiple machine learning, statistical and geometric algorithms to solve real-world business problems.  Applications deployed with Ayasdi demonstrate characteristics of intelligence.  They discover information that is latent in big and/or high dimensional data, they learn and predict the future with high accuracy as well as improve over time with experience, they justify their actions, predictions and discoveries in a transparent and statistically proven fashion and they can act based on data, recommend actions to humans, and can react to changes.", "How It Works Video Url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6XXN94xYU", "Value Proposition Text": "Our Vision  At Ayasdi, we believe that deriving insight from big data will become essential and transformative for every enterprise.

It has been developed by the AltexSoft team in order to substitute an older version of the company\u2019s booking service.\n\nOne of the major product updates that needed to be delivered by our team was Fareboom Price Predictor. The goal was to implement an innovative fare forecast feature on top of the company\u2019s existing travel booking engine. Price Predictor had to complement the core search functionality and help users make better purchasing decisions. It needed to be designed for the price sensitive customer to target the best possible time to buy an airline ticket over several months.\n\nBusiness Challenges\nSince Microsoft withdrew its Bing flight predictor feature from the Travel portal in 2014, major market players have been trying to take its place. While other services, such as Kayak fare predictor and Skyscanner, offer similar fare movement forecast options, the niche is still highly competitive as there is always room for improvement.\n\nArmed with 10+ years of experience in the travel industry, our client has decided to enter the competition in order to provide users with better customer service and more price saving opportunities. The goal was to build an intelligent algorithm, able to forecast future price movements based on historical data and smart predictive analytics models.\n\nThe project consisted of several tasks:\n\nIn-depth research and historical data analysis\nPrediction algorithm development and enhancements\nUser experience and performance optimization\nValue Delivered\nSimilar to Bing travel predictor, the Fareboom Price Predictor is aimed at helping users make informed decisions as to when to buy tickets or how long to wait to get the best flight deals. In order to provide the expected project results, our team delivered the following milestones:\n\nUncovering the Hidden Patterns in Large Dataset\nTo be able to predict the future price movements, our data scientists studied the historical data about airfare trend changes over the past several years. The actual information from millions of searches, processed by the Fareboom search engine was used, to make the predictions highly reliable. In order to increase the amount of data and statistical power, we handled neighbor travel dates data and clever merging algorithms to form the time series for further forecasting. Employing advanced data mining and aggregation techniques, the team was able to understand and visualize the hidden patterns.\n\nPredicting the Future Price Movements with High Confidence\nBased on discovered patterns, the team formed algorithm models with different parameters. The info about actual flight fares helped us find the most suitable prediction algorithm: Setting the system parameters of the recent past, our data scientist ran the algorithm to predict the fares we already knew. Thus, we were able to validate or disprove the hypothesis based on exact information.

To this we've also added emoji support, sentiment analysis, dialog management or expression suggestions, leveraging data augmentation to drastically fasten bot building. This NLP technology allows the creation of chatbots in any language, from English to Hebrew through Japanese. \nSecond, bot building is done through our free platform. In this platform, we've developed a complete suite of tools for bot building. Developers can train their bot, build their conversational flow in a visual builder (using our unique Bot Skills technology), connect bots to any channel in a few clicks (Messenger, Slack, Kik, Skype, etc) and monitor its use. All of this for free.\nFinally, from the beginning, Recast.AI has been a collaborative platform. Today, more than 25,000 developers use our technology and tools. Bots built on Recast.AI can be forked, Bot Skills can be shared, and you can work collaboratively on a bot. The community also exchanges tips and tricks on our Slack Community.\n\nWhile our technology is used by developers all around the world, we also work closely with major corporations to automate their customer supports with chatbots. \n\nWith Recast.AI, you have all tools necessary to the building of powerful bots and can provide great conversational interfaces in a heartbeat. \"", "Value

Computers are able to ingest large and complex data sets and do what humans are incapable of, which is to make sense of all possible relationships amongst that data, in a reasonable amount of time. This is true even when the data involved is massive\u2013 imagine trying to make sense of a spreadsheet with billions of rows or a hundred thousand columns. Humans don\u2019t even know where to begin.  The industrial revolution in the early 19th century caused a shift in human capabilities. Machines improved the quality of what could be manufactured, increased workforce productivity, replaced unskilled human labor, and enabled the development of new products that were far beyond the capabilities of humans to produce. AI is rapidly creating a parallel revolution, but this time for knowledge-based processes instead of physical processes, and for white-collar workers instead of factory employees.  The collection and analysis of data from transactions, sensors, and biometrics continues to grow at a prodigious rate, taxing the analytic capabilities of even the most sophisticated organizations. The quantity of possible insights in a given dataset is an exponential function of the number of data points. On top of this, aggregate data growth is an exponential function with time. Unfortunately, the world cannot train enough data scientists to meet this runaway, double-exponential demand curve for analytics.  This dynamic is driving computer scientists and mathematicians alike to examine new approaches to interact with big and high dimensional data.  Today\u2019s hypothesis-driven analytics and manual machine learning algorithms and statistical tools will not suffice. High-performance computers and algorithms can examine big and complex data far faster and seek insights more comprehensively than any human is capable of.   Ayasdi's core technology innovation is our development of artificial intelligence platform that automatically selects and combines multiple machine learning, statistical and geometric algorithms to solve real-world business problems.  Applications deployed with Ayasdi demonstrate characteristics of intelligence.

A technology platform built around our back to biology approach to the research and development of treatments for patients. While traditional pharma approaches drug discovery through chemical libraries and hypothesis, we start with the patient's own biology.  Patient samples are collected in both diseased and healthy states and are processed by our high throughput mass spectrometer workflow. Here we analyze the biological activity and make up the sample through adaptive omics. This includes the genome, proteome, lipidome and metabolome. We also look at mitochondrial function, oxidative states, and ATP production to examine how the cells are functioning. The process produces trillions of data points from a single sample. The data is then combined with patient clinical information and analyzed by our proprietary artificial intelligence machine learning analytics program. This combination of systems biology and artificial intelligence is the BERG Interrogative Biology\u00ae platform.  Our platform analyzes the patient data in an unbiased way looking at all the data in a deep learning process. This analysis gives us a picture of the activity of the biological systems within the patient. A network of connections and activity is generated that can be studied further by additional statistical analysis to reveal the biomarkers for a disease. These biomarkers can lead to new diagnostic tests and therapeutic treatments for patients. BERG's Interrogative Biology\u00ae platform is the central driver of our Next Generation Medicine\u2122 program. Our platform's unique combination of adaptive-omic biological data and advanced AI machine learning algorithms allow us to stratify patient populations by phenotype to build predictive models. The model can be applied to an individual patient's clinical information to predict the efficacy of a drug or screen out potentially toxic treatments.  Our platform will bring true precision to healthcare delivering the right treatments to the right patients at the right time. Next generation medicine may greatly improve patient outcomes while also reducing incidents of hospital admissions due to toxicity benefiting the healthcare system as a whole.  Precision medicine has great potential to empower providers and patients to better understand patient health and treatment options. BERG Analytics, a division of BERG, provides real time analytic solutions that predict the impact of treatment plans at the individual level to optimize population health strategies. With our patented analytics engine, bAIcis\u2122, Berg Analytics empowers health plans, providers, EHR vendors, and clinical decision support organizations to plan, implement and measure interventions that benefit individuals. bAIcis\u2122 also provides organizations with actionable Patient Intelligence\u2122 to drive population-level efficiency.

Our approach consists of modeling the phenomena that are critical to the success of hits, leads, and candidates. We then apply these models to spaces of drug-like chemistry large enough to contain many, many potential solutions.  This comprehensive data-driven approach allows us not only to model phenomena like binding to a target, but also to model the efficacy of compounds, and their ADME properties and off-target toxicities, as well as other properties. How does our platform affect the way we run programs? Here is an example:  At the start of a typical program, we virtually assay 25 million compounds from a bespoke, focused virtual library of 1 trillion (or more) compounds, against a handful of accurate activity, selectivity and ADME models at a cost of one-one hundredth of a penny per compound, in about one week. These results are analyzed by our chemists, and the most promising series are commissioned for synthesis and testing.  The laboratory results are then fed back into the models to further improve their accuracy, and the cycle repeats. Each cycle takes less time as the search focuses in an iterative fashion on the more promising spaces of chemistry.  At the core of the platform is our machine-learning-based modeling capability. This is really our secret sauce.  What distinguishes our modeling approach is its ability to leverage all types of data (both ranged and discrete) and all sources of data (including literature references and patents), combining many kinds of experiments (cell-free binding experiments, whole-cell experiments), and putting them together into a single model which appropriately deals with the bias, noise, and complexity present in any SAR data set.

It has been developed by the AltexSoft team in order to substitute an older version of the company\u2019s booking service.\n\nOne of the major product updates that needed to be delivered by our team was Fareboom Price Predictor. The goal was to implement an innovative fare forecast feature on top of the company\u2019s existing travel booking engine. Price Predictor had to complement the core search functionality and help users make better purchasing decisions. It needed to be designed for the price sensitive customer to target the best possible time to buy an airline ticket over several months.\n\nBusiness Challenges\nSince Microsoft withdrew its Bing flight predictor feature from the Travel portal in 2014, major market players have been trying to take its place. While other services, such as Kayak fare predictor and Skyscanner, offer similar fare movement forecast options, the niche is still highly competitive as there is always room for improvement.\n\nArmed with 10+ years of experience in the travel industry, our client has decided to enter the competition in order to provide users with better customer service and more price saving opportunities. The goal was to build an intelligent algorithm, able to forecast future price movements based on historical data and smart predictive analytics models.\n\nThe project consisted of several tasks:\n\nIn-depth research and historical data analysis\nPrediction algorithm development and enhancements\nUser experience and performance optimization\nValue Delivered\nSimilar to Bing travel predictor, the Fareboom Price Predictor is aimed at helping users make informed decisions as to when to buy tickets or how long to wait to get the best flight deals. In order to provide the expected project results, our team delivered the following milestones:\n\nUncovering the Hidden Patterns in Large Dataset\nTo be able to predict the future price movements, our data scientists studied the historical data about airfare trend changes over the past several years. The actual information from millions of searches, processed by the Fareboom search engine was used, to make the predictions highly reliable. In order to increase the amount of data and statistical power, we handled neighbor travel dates data and clever merging algorithms to form the time series for further forecasting. Employing advanced data mining and aggregation techniques, the team was able to understand and visualize the hidden patterns.\n\nPredicting the Future Price Movements with High Confidence\nBased on discovered patterns, the team formed algorithm models with different parameters. The info about actual flight fares helped us find the most suitable prediction algorithm: Setting the system parameters of the recent past, our data scientist ran the algorithm to predict the fares we already knew. Thus, we were able to validate or disprove the hypothesis based on exact information. The final algorithm has an average confidence rate of 75% and uses a time series forecasting to make both long-term (7 weeks) and short-term (7 days) predictions. The algorithm is constantly being improved through machine learning techniques, based on the factual information about the confirmed and disproved predictions.\n\nSeamless Price Predictor Integration and Optimized Experience\nThe Price Predictor feature is integrated into the existing fare search functionality and is shown to a certain segment of the Fareboom users (currently about 20%). Being displayed in a form of a search module and a popup window, it is sure to grasp the user\u2019s attention and allows for a multitude of interactions (e.g. Close Popup, See More) and events (e.g. scroll, hover over, etc.). Therefore, we can track multiple stats and adjust the user experience based on them. For example, we have found that Price Predictor has doubled the average time per session within a month since the release and continues to grow the conversion.", "Video URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS1P8yokFf8&feature=youtu.be"}}, "Address": {"City": "Carlsbad", "Region": "California", "Country": "United States"}, "Founded Year": 2007, "Number Of Employees": 200, "Capital Raised": 0, "Capital Raised Currency": "$", "How It Works Text": "Our services:\n\nEngineering services\n           \u2219 Software Product Development\n           \u2219 Team Extension\n\nData Science\n           \u2219 Machine Learning\n           \u2219 Predictive Analytics\n\nUX/UI Consulting\n           \u2219 UX Design\n           \u2219 Conversion Rate Optimization\n\nTechnology Consulting\n          \u2219 Enterprise Architecture\n          \u2219 Performance Improvements\n          \u2219 Cloud Services\n\n\nDomain expertise: \n    \u2219 Finance \n    \u2219 Health Care\n    \u2219 eCommerce & Retail\n    \u2219 Travel\n    \u2219 Media & Entertainment\n    \u2219 Marketing\n    \u2219 Aviation & Transportation\n\n\nTechnology expertise:\n\n    \u2219 Microsoft.NET \n    \u2219 LAMP \n    \u2219 HTML, CSS, UI JavaScript\n    \u2219 Cross-Platform and Native Mobile \n    \u2219 Java \n    \u2219 R, Python \n    \u2219 Cloud Technologies \n    \u2219 Full Stack JavaScript", "How It Works Video Url": null, "Value Proposition Text": "Being a Technology & Solution Consulting company, we co-build technology products to help companies accelerate growth.

This technology, based on deep learning, allows our users to analyse sentences, detect their intent (classification) and extract key information called entities (named entity recognition or NER). Recast.AI provides by default an extensive enrichment of 35+ entities such as location, datetimes or temperatures. To this we've also added emoji support, sentiment analysis, dialog management or expression suggestions, leveraging data augmentation to drastically fasten bot building. This NLP technology allows the creation of chatbots in any language, from English to Hebrew through Japanese. \nSecond, bot building is done through our free platform. In this platform, we've developed a complete suite of tools for bot building. Developers can train their bot, build their conversational flow in a visual builder (using our unique Bot Skills technology), connect bots to any channel in a few clicks (Messenger, Slack, Kik, Skype, etc) and monitor its use. All of this for free.\nFinally, from the beginning, Recast.AI has been a collaborative platform. Today, more than 25,000 developers use our technology and tools. Bots built on Recast.AI can be forked, Bot Skills can be shared, and you can work collaboratively on a bot. The community also exchanges tips and tricks on our Slack Community.\n\nWhile our technology is used by developers all around the world, we also work closely with major corporations to automate their customer supports with chatbots. \n\nWith Recast.AI, you have all tools necessary to the building of powerful bots and can provide great conversational interfaces in a heartbeat. \"", "Value
